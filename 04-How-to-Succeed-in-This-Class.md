# How to Succeed in this Class (and in life)

If you wish to succeed (and achieve a good grade), please do the following:

* Show up for class – every class. This course depends on student
  engagement.
* Contribute consistently to the creative community and respond to the
  contributions of others.
* Take the initiative to plan and develop your composition. This
  course is (very likely) more fluid and organic than you are used
  to. Your ability to manage your time, commitment, and energy is
  crucial.
* Speak up in every class.
* Don’t look for the right answer to a question or challenge. Instead,
  find the answer that is meaningful to you.
* Ask for help if you need it. Open an issue if you need help (use the `Issues` tab).
* Commit to your project in a substantial way. Good projects take
  time. Rushed projects are obviously rushed.

Finally, please be attentive to the [KPU policies](https://www.kpu.ca/policies)
on academic honesty and plagiarism.
