# Supplies

This course includes eleven excurions outdoors, typically to a local park in the South Fraser region. The weather and the environment will always be changebale and unpredictable. These park visits take place rain or shine (except in extreme weather). Accordingly, please bring the following items to each field trip:

* Your wits
* Your common sense
* Your maturity
* A sense of humour
* Enthusiasm
* A positive mindset

That's most of what you need, for these field trips and for anything else. But please also bring the following:

* A phone (fully charged)
* Water
* A snack
* A rain jacket
* A change of shoes and socks, for particularly rainy or muddy trips
* A warm jacket (a thick fleece or puffy is ideal)
* A hat or umbrella (or both, depending on your appetite for the rain)
* A notebook (this is a writing course, after all, and writing on your phone is a terrible idea)
* A pen, and a spare pen (please review the first list above if you did not think of this)

Place these items in a backpack (not a purse), and carry all your gear with you in such a way that you have two free hands. If you want to bring trekking poles, you are welcome to do so; however, we will not be traversing any significant terrain. All of our locations have gravel or dirt paths and no hills (with the exception of the Delta Watershed and Campbell Valley, both of which have one hill).
