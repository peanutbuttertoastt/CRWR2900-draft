### Activities and Engagement

The expectation is that you will attend all sessions and involve yourself in the class process. Your willingness to engage creatively with the learning process, to take appropriate personal risks, and to participate in group activities are all central to your involvement in this class. Because developing a style of authentic creative inquiry is very much a process of blending your own personal awareness with skills and practical techniques, your own emotional involvement in the class is as important as your academic knowledge of the material.

It's easy to identify those who possess exemplary interpersonal and creative
skills. They are relaxed, open, responsive, and kind. Often they exhibit skills
that we tend to assign to the social sphere: personal warmth, consideration of
others, hesitancy to judge, sensitivity to emotions. In our class we focus on
these interpersonal factors as a foundation for our experiences with one
another. And we itemize them as features along the continuum of self-awareness:

* Commitment to the development of self-awareness.
* Openness to interpersonal process.
* Ability to participate in appropriate self-disclosure.
* Consideration of and responsiveness to others.
* Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the class.
* Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.
* Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.
* Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.
* Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.

Each item on the above list is an aspect of the first item:
self-awareness. The most foundational skill in creativity is
self-awareness. Those who develop this skill consistently query their
own responses, thoughts, and feelings. They ask themselves:

* What am I feeling right now?
* What am I thinking right now?
* Why am I reacting in this particular way?
* What do my thoughts, feelings, and reactions tell me about myself?
* Is there anything about my current behavior that suggests unresolved themes in my life?
* Is my perception of myself consistent with what other people tell me about the kind of person I am?
* When and how do I get stuck, and what am I doing to work on this?
* In what ways do I get overwhelmed, or shut down, or avoid?

These questions, and many others, require the capacity for self-reflection and
self-awareness. As we continue in the course, you may wish to consider these
questions as they apply to you.
