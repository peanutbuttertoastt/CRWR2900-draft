Burns Bog 

-Even in a nature reserve, you can still hear the egos of people from the honks of their overpriced cars
-Do the animals know that the commotion is from humans? Do they blame someone?

-The mossy ground bounces like a trampoline/like a sponge
-The black spruce trees look like tree people

-Sitka spruce, play my instrument (like this as personification) 

*being at the back of the group isn't so bad.. you get more solitude

If a Douglas fir doesn't catch fire, it doesn't germinate 
-A douglas fir NEEDS a forest fire in order to survive 
(like we need advisory to survive) 

Spotlights have been shining on the biggest, tallest trees, (highlighting them). Now as I sit on this beat down tree, I am in the spotlight, but I am not the biggest or tallest, and not the most worthy to be highlighted

*The sun fades away from me, like the plug of a lamp being ripped from a power source. I feel cold
