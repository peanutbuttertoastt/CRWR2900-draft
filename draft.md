EXPERIENCES IN COLLECTIVE THOUGHTS: 

As I walk through these patches of nature within the city, I notice how you can never really escape the noisiness and disruption of people. I notice the want to be by myself comes out even more in these situations. The want to be able to freely wander these small pockets of forest all alone - in silence. The more that I do this, the more I find that this is not possible. If I want to be in silence, I have to either drive hours away and hike to a remote spot in the forest, or I have to pretend and wear noise-cancelling earplugs in hopes of hearing nothing.  

The only time I have really felt a part of nature was at the third lake at Joffre Lakes. A group of us backpacked up, expecting to stay the night. It was so quiet, with only a handful of people there. The waterfall in the distance sounded like a huge fan (like the ones they use for photo-shoots for the models), and was so comforting. It rushed over us all night, and swept into our dreams, and created showers. We could see all of the stars for once. Little to no light pollution. It scared me to be able to see so much of another world. We watched the constellations trickle across the sky. 

The next morning, I sulked at the fact that we had to leave. My skin wanted to stick to this new place like the stickers on my childhood bedroom door, never to be removed. We asked our group if it would be okay if we split into two groups so we could scramble up the mountain we slept beside the night before. I wanted to stay for weeks, beside that beautiful mousse-textured waterfall. No electricity, no distractions. No sadness. I just felt content in where I was, and who I was. I felt no need to be anywhere, and no need to tell anyone where I was, or where I was going. We scattered and crawled up the rocky surface toward the top like mountain lions. Each of our paws clutching onto each rock in front our eyes. We warned eachother not to climb directly behind on another because of the miniature avalanches us as humans were causing. When we reached the top, my hat dripped once as I looked toward the sun. The third lake greeted us with a corner of bright aquamarine blue. It really was marvelous. 

My socks slipped into the water, and I watched them float away into the ripples.

Biography

I am not a maple 
I am not 
a maple
falls slowly 
like a helicopter leaf 
drifting, swaying 

I am not sweet 
I am not 
sweet syrup 
ooses out of bark
lick
the stickyness on your lips 

I am not permanent 
I am not 
black ink 
spills soaking 
white tshirts
staining  

I am not plastic 
I am not 
toss behind you
wrinkled paper 
crinkled mess 
mazes in heads 

I am not a clue 
I am not 
Etcha-sketch 
make your own art 
scribble 
out mistakes 

I am not soap
I am not 
fresh air 
oxygen to lungs
suffocation 
pillows murmered words

Poem Untitled (for now)

step outside
roll your neck around
cracks in spine
exhale 
a deep ah let out
cold lips 
chapped surface 
close eyelids over eyes 
white space 
create a story 

a stick-man figure walks
he wears no clothes 
but he wears a hat 
policeman 
he is happy
sits at a desk
no one else there
picks up the cup 
hums himself a song 
mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm 


  The lake swam beside us while we slept. As I drifted in and out of consciousness, I could hear it's limbs climbing up the rocks on the shore. I laid on my back for a moment trying to convince myself to go back to sleep as I observed the inside of the tent, but my curiosity kept me awake. I unzipped my sleeping bag slowly to avoid waking up Cristian beside me. I hopped over his still body and carefully crawled out of our tent. While I walked closer to the glacier water, I paused to breathe deeply and looked up at the stars. My toes were cold in the breeze with just a pair of socks and flip-flops to shield my feet. It was silent for a moment until I heard a playful splash come from the lake, which drew my attention away from the Christmas lights in the sky. I walked further down in hopes of seeing someone else from my hiking group sitting by the water. My tender cheeks reached my ears, and I let out a breathy laugh as I tiptoed down the incline. It was hard to see where my feet were landing and I could feel the uneven rocks beneath me. Each one became more and more wobbly as I went on. 
  
  "Shit!" I screeched as I tumbled onto the dirt in front of me.   My arms lengthened and almost made contact with the water. My wrists ached from the hard landing and my hips felt like they had just been dragged against a carpet. With no one else around, I closed my eyes and curled into a fetal position to comfort my hurting, and as I finally felt the burning slowly ease away, I felt a tickle on my fingertips. The lake was using its soft waves in attempt to gain my attention. The water reached out to me, and grabbed my hand in hopes of swinging me in. I gasped not knowing what its intentions were. It spoke to me, and told me it would cast a blanket of warmth over my body. 

"The cold won't touch you," it whispered. 

"I-I..." I shook my head and began to quickly shuffle away from the shore. 

I was suddenly stopped by a rock at my heels that knocked me down to a sitting position. I slumped, implying that I had given up to the water. 

“I can’t!” I shouted back to the water. My eyes filled with water. “I can’t,” I said with defeat.

“Trust.” It whispered.

I paused for a moment to allow some of my thoughts to circle and make sense. After a few minutes, I swallowed its words, and began to peel my socks off of my feet. I walked down to where the water kissed the shore and dipped the top of my toes into the treading water. It cooled me, and created bumps on each of my arms. My insides grew with cold but I liked it. It felt new. It felt natural for once. At the same time, my socks slipped into the water, and I watched them float away into the ripples. 

“Why’d you do that?” 

“Swim with me,” the water replied as it splashed up onto my shins.

I smiled nervously but felt a sensation of happiness within me. My doubt faded as my mind emptied. To notice nothing but my breath was refreshing. I stood with the bottom half of my legs submerged in the water and just breathed, noticing each breath more, each exhale more.

All of a sudden I noticed there weren't many animals around. They were all hiding away from even the few people around their homes. I then thought, maybe they were surrounding us, but underneath all of the rocks. Thinking about all the little creatures swirling around us underground was such a cool thought. I touched the front of my tongue to my two top front teeth and made a sticky sound. The call I'd use for my cats back at home. I moved my head around to see if I could hear any movements in the dark and suddenly, I whipped toward my right ear. I made the sticky sound again. There was one small movement in the bush beside me so I kneeled down slowly and reached my hands out on the ground in front of me. My eyes widened to compensate for the moon being my only light source. I breathed out loudly instead of letting out a gasp. There it was, a little creature the size of a hamster, no tail, plump. It hid partially behind the bush, but I used the sticky noise once more to call it over into the palm of my hands. 

"Hey little guy," I said while slowly standing up. "It's alright, I've got you." I hushed. 

  With the hamster-like creature in my hands, I walked along the shore. I found a comfortable rock to sit on and rested there while I pet the top of the creature's head. It was calm, but I sensed it's fear from the stiffness of it's body so I gently put him back down on the gravel. He scurried away quietly, and returned to his secret home underneath the ground. I became completely alone and my thoughts started to become more present. I sat watching the two or three insects that felt brave enough to venture pass me, or just didn't notice my presence. My eyes wandered like binoculars looking for the moon in the daylight, and finally were able to focus on the turqoise waves. With the silence seeping in, I began to examine my clothing patterns, texture, color, and started to realize that I didn't blend in with everything around me. Even though I had such a strong want to stay there forever, I knew I couldn't survive. I had become too dependent on "city life" and the conveniences attached to that idea. 

finds a hurt animals of some kind...brings it to the water... please help water....helps... returns to tent...wakes up cristian accidentally..asks where she has been....just looking at the lake she says...watch the constallations trickle across the sky 


The blue of the lake took over the sky 
My hands turned purple 
as the chill trickled into my veins 
I looked down at my hands
wiggled my fingers 
tried to shake away tingling sensations
but they started to stiffen
and the bones inside begin to lock
unable to move
the natural rhythm of my body 
a board 
that drifts across the water 
under the stars
stiff 
silent
