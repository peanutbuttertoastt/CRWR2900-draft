Burns Bog:

-Even in a nature reserve, you can still hear the egos of people from the honks of their overpriced cars
-Do the animals know that the commotion is from humans? Do they blame someone?

-The mossy ground bounces like a trampoline/like a sponge
-The black spruce trees look like tree people, waving to me

-Sitka spruce, play my instrument (like this as personification) 

*being at the back of the group isn't so bad.. you get more solitude

If a Douglas fir doesn't catch fire, it doesn't germinate 
-A douglas fir NEEDS a forest fire in order to survive 
(like we need advisory to survive) 

Spotlights have been shining on the biggest, tallest trees, (highlighting them). Now as I sit on this beat down tree, I am in the spotlight, but I am not the biggest or tallest, and not the most worthy to be highlighted

*The sun fades away from me, like the plug of a lamp being ripped from a power source. I feel cold
Now a tree creaks like an ungreased door hinge opening slowly. The more I listen, the less it sounds likea tree. Is it a bird? More than one? Talking to eachother about why there are so many people around their home all of a sudden?

*I wish I could adventure the forest on my own without the fear of another human being. (not even scared of the wildlife. People are unpredictable and scary) 

With my brightly colour everything in my clothing, I sit here and wish that I blended in with nature more...
Our bodies are so fragile to the elements from our home - Earth. If I were to walk barefoot now, that's all I'd be focusing on. 

Even though I am right beside the city, and can hear it clearly... looking out, I want to climb the tallest tree we pass by, just to see the city again. 


Mud Bay:

We are too close to the highway to feel like we are in "nature" 
The way the Earth works is so beautiful. Everything falls into the perfect puzzle. Each line matching up perfectly. And even when it seems like you are missing a piece, you look on the ground, and it is right there waiting.

Sitting in silence is one of my favourite things. I can have conversations with myself in my head if I am feeling talkitive, but have no one with me. 
Each of the rocks I pick up has a new texture, has a new smell, a new shape. All unique, but placed perfectly. 

I want to visit the little island over there that hasn't been touched. But if I do, it will have been touched by humans just like everything else. 

The mud here shatters here like crackled nailpolish. A common trend when I was in highschool. It feels like I should be falling through the cracks, but everything holds onto me. Like I'm tucked safely in the pouch of my mother's warmth. I am safe here. 


Kwomais Point Park: 

Add to narrative: "We watched the constallations trickle across the sky, through the mesh in our tent."

-baby's skin that has never seen the sun

-tyre - self sacrifice (tyre'sday, tuesday) 

-moving from doing to just BEING
-Labrynth walking: The moments of silence in your head are SO nice. You can be with yourself, without the anxiety of your thoughts taking over. You become it isn't about getting to the middle, but simply the journey of your walk. The slower you go, the better. 



EXPERIENCES IN COLLECTIVE THOUGHTS: 

As I walk through these patches of nature within the city, I notice how you can never really escape the noisiness and disruption of people. I notice the want to be by myself comes out even more in these situations. The want to be able to freely wander these small pockets of forest all alone - in silence. The more that I do this, the more I find that this is not possible. If I want to be in silence, I have to either drive hours away and hike to a remote spot in the forest, or I have to pretend and wear noise-cancelling earplugs in hopes of hearing nothing. 

I sit on a log, watching the two or three insects that feel brave enough to venture pass me (that, or they just don't notice me.) My eyes wander like binoculars looking for the moon in the daylight, and finally are able to focus. I stare at the rusty moss beneath my feet, and feel the sponge-like surface under me. I feel unstable, but know I will not fall. I examine my clothing, patterns, texture, colour, and realize I don't blend in here. I stick out, just like that care person's starbucks cup left on the side of a beautiful beach. I have an endless feeling of want to belong here. I wish I could live here, but I have become too dependent on the "city life." 

The only time I have really felt a part of nature was at the third lake at Joffre Lakes. A group of us backpacked up, expecting to stay the night. It was so quiet, with only a handfull of people there. The waterfall in the distance sounded like a huge fan (like the ones they use for photo-shoots for the models), and was so comforting. It rushed over us all night, and swept into our dreams, and created showers. We could see all of the stars for once. Little to no light pollution. It scared me to be able to see so much of another world. We watched the constillations trickle across the sky. 

The next morning, I sulked at the fact that we had to leave. My skin wanted to stick to this new place like the stickers on my childhood bedroom door, never to be removed. We asked our group if it would be okay if we split into two groups so we could scramble up the mountain we slept beside. I wanted to stay for weeks, beside that beautiful mousse-textured waterfall. No electricity, no distractions. No sadness. I just felt content in where I was, and who I was. I felt no need to be anywhere, and no need to tell anyone where I was, or where I was going. We scattered and crawled up the rocky surface toward the top like mountain lions. Each of our paws clutching onto each rock in front our eyes. We warned eachother not to climb directly behind on another because of the miniature avalanches us as humans were causing. When we reached the top, my hat dripped once as I looked toward the sun. The third lake greeted us with a corner of bright aquamarine blue. It really was marvelous. 

The lake swam beside us while we slept, and while we woke. I could hear it's limbs climbing up the rocks on the shore. It reached out to me, and grabbed my hand, in hopes of swinging me in. My mind wandered away from the idea of swimming in glacier water at nine o'clock in the morning. It spoke to me, and told me it would cast a blanket of warmth over my body. 
"The cold won't touch you," it whispered to me. 

I swallowed its words, and tapped the top of my toes into the treading water. It cooled me, and created bumps on each of my arms. I screamed, but I liked it. It felt new. It felt natural for once. 

My socks slipped into the water, and I watched them float away into the ripples. 

I noticed there weren't many animals around us. They were all hiding away from even the few people around their homes. I then thought, maybe they were surrounding us, but underneath all of the rocks. Little creatures swirling around us underground. Such a cool thought. A rat-sized squirrel peeped out of a hole in a bunch of rocks. Not a squirrel, but something very similar. Almost like a hamster I had when I was nearly five years old. So cute. So wild.


*the goal is to create a story from this. A (sort of) non-fiction piece about an experience I had up at the top of Joffre Lakes. I want to bring in elements from each of our outings - whether it be a clever thought or a cool image.
