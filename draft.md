EXPERIENCES IN COLLECTIVE THOUGHTS: 

As I walk through these patches of nature within the city, I notice how you can never really escape the noisiness and disruption of people. I notice the want to be by myself comes out even more in these situations. The want to be able to freely wander these small pockets of forest all alone - in silence. The more that I do this, the more I find that this is not possible. If I want to be in silence, I have to either drive hours away and hike to a remote spot in the forest, or I have to pretend and wear noise-cancelling earplugs in hopes of hearing nothing. 

I sit on a log, watching the two or three insects that feel brave enough to venture pass me (that, or they just don't notice me.) My eyes wander like binoculars looking for the moon in the daylight, and finally are able to focus. I stare at the rusty moss beneath my feet, and feel the sponge-like surface under me. I feel unstable, but know I will not fall. I examine my clothing, patterns, texture, colour, and realize I don't blend in here. I stick out, just like that care person's starbucks cup left on the side of a beautiful beach. I have an endless feeling of want to belong here. I wish I could live here, but I have become too dependent on the "city life." 

The only time I have really felt a part of nature was at the third lake at Joffre Lakes. A group of us backpacked up, expecting to stay the night. It was so quiet, with only a handfull of people there. The waterfall in the distance sounded like a huge fan (like the ones they use for photo-shoots for the models), and was so comforting. It rushed over us all night, and swept into our dreams, and created showers. We could see all of the stars for once. Little to no light pollution. It scared me to be able to see so much of another world. We watched the constillations trickle across the sky. 

The next morning, I sulked at the fact that we had to leave. My skin wanted to stick to this new place like the stickers on my childhood bedroom door, never to be removed. We asked our group if it would be okay if we split into two groups so we could scramble up the mountain we slept beside the night before. I wanted to stay for weeks, beside that beautiful mousse-textured waterfall. No electricity, no distractions. No sadness. I just felt content in where I was, and who I was. I felt no need to be anywhere, and no need to tell anyone where I was, or where I was going. We scattered and crawled up the rocky surface toward the top like mountain lions. Each of our paws clutching onto each rock in front our eyes. We warned eachother not to climb directly behind on another because of the miniature avalanches us as humans were causing. When we reached the top, my hat dripped once as I looked toward the sun. The third lake greeted us with a corner of bright aquamarine blue. It really was marvelous. 

The lake swam beside us while we slept, and while we woke. I could hear it's limbs climbing up the rocks on the shore. It reached out to me, and grabbed my hand, in hopes of swinging me in. My mind wandered away from the idea of swimming in glacier water at nine o'clock in the morning. It spoke to me, and told me it would cast a blanket of warmth over my body. 
"The cold won't touch you," it whispered. 

I swallowed its words, and tapped the top of my toes into the treading water. It cooled me, and created bumps on each of my arms. I screamed, but I liked it. It felt new. It felt natural for once. 

My socks slipped into the water, and I watched them float away into the ripples. 

I noticed there weren't many animals around us. They were all hiding away from even the few people around their homes. I then thought, maybe they were surrounding us, but underneath all of the rocks. Little creatures swirling around us underground. Such a cool thought. A rat-sized squirrel peeped out of a hole in a bunch of rocks. Not a squirrel, but something very similar. Almost like a hamster I had when I was nearly five years old. So cute. So wild.


The goal is to write a piece about an experience I had up at the top of Joffre Lakes. I am leaning more toward poetry at this point in time now, but I want to include and exerpt of narrative either at the beginning or the end. 

*ALSO I am not able to view my issues or create an issue for some reason.. 


POEMS:

Biography

I am not a maple 
I am not 
a maple
falls slowly 
like a helicopter leaf 
drifting, swaying 

I am not sweet 
I am not 
sweet syrup 
ooses out of bark
lick
the stickyness on your lips 

I am not permanent 
I am not 
black ink 
spills soaking 
white tshirts
staining  

I am not plastic 
I am not 
toss behind you
wrinkled paper 
crinkled mess 
mazes in heads 

I am not a clue 
I am not 
Etcha-sketch 
make your own art 
scribble 
out mistakes 

I am not soap
I am not 
fresh air 
oxygen to lungs
suffocation 
pillows murmered words

Poem Untitled (for now)

step outside
roll your neck around
cracks in spine
exhale 
a deep ah let out
cold lips 
chapped surface 
close eyelids over eyes 
white space 
create a story 

a stick-man figure walks
he wears no clothes 
but he wears a hat 
policeman 
he is happy
sits at a desk
no one else there
picks up the cup 
hums himself a song 
mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm 


  The lake swam beside us while we slept. As I drifted in and out of conciousness, I could hear it's limbs climbing up the rocks on the shore. I unzipped my sleeping bag slowly to avoid waking up Cristian beside me. I hopped over his still body and carefully crawled out of our tent. While I walked closer to the glacier water, I paused to breathe deeply and looked up at the starsâ€“my toes were cold in the breeze with just a pair of socks and flip-flops to shiled my feet. It was silent for a moment until I heard a playful splash come from the lake which drew my attention away from the christmas lights in the sky. I walked further down in hopes of seeing someone else from my hiking group sitting down by the water. My tender cheeks reached my ears, and I let out a breathy laugh. It was hard to see where my feet were landing and I could feel the uneven rocks underneath me. Each one became more and more wobbly as I went on. 
  
  "Shit!" I screached as I tumbled onto the dirt infront of me. My arms lengthened and were almost making contact with the water. My wrists ached from the hard landing and my hips felt like they had just been dragged against a carpet. I closed my eyes and curled into a fetal position to comfort my hurting, and as I finally almost felt the burning easing away, I felt a tickle on my finger tips. The lakes waves were approaching me. It reached out to me, and grabbed my hand in hopes of swinging me in. It spoke to me, and told me it would cast a blanket of warmth over my body. 
"The cold won't touch you," it whispered. 

I swallowed its words, and tapped the top of my toes into the treading water. It cooled me, and created bumps on each of my arms. I screamed, but I liked it. It felt new. It felt natural for once. 

My socks slipped into the water, and I watched them float away into the ripples.
