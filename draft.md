# Your Draft

This is your draft. You will replace this placeholder text with your own text.

Here is a new paragraph. It has a blank line before it. Generally, the only formatting you will need to know about is how to create new paragraphs, headers, and links. Here's a handy [guide on those topics](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/). You may wish to bookmark it.

You can leave this placeholder text here if you want. You could start writing at the top, and this text will be moved down as you write. If you choose to do that, you might also wish to create a horizontal line at the top, to separate your text from this placeholder text. To do that, just type three dashes in a row. Like this:

---

Those three dashes will be converted into a horizontal line going all the way across when you preview the document. Try that now: click the Preview button above. Then click the Edit button to come back to this view and make your changes.

Happy writing!
