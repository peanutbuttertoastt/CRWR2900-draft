-Even in a nature reserve, you can still hear the egos of people from the honks of their overpriced cars
-Do the animals know that the commotion is from humans? Do they blame someone?

-The mossy ground bounces like a trampoline/like a sponge
-The black spruce trees look like tree people, waving to me

-Sitka spruce, play my instrument (like this as personification) 

*being at the back of the group isn't so bad.. you get more solitude

If a Douglas fir doesn't catch fire, it doesn't germinate 
-A douglas fir NEEDS a forest fire in order to survive 
(like we need advisory to survive) 

Spotlights have been shining on the biggest, tallest trees, (highlighting them). Now as I sit on this beat down tree, I am in the spotlight, but I am not the biggest or tallest, and not the most worthy to be highlighted

*The sun fades away from me, like the plug of a lamp being ripped from a power source. I feel cold
Now a tree creaks like an ungreased door hinge opening slowly. The more I listen, the less it sounds likea tree. Is it a bird? More than one? Talking to eachother about why there are so many people around their home all of a sudden?

*I wish I could adventure the forest on my own without the fear of another human being. (not even scared of the wildlife. People are unpredictable and scary) 

With my brightly colour everything in my clothing, I sit here and wish that I blended in with nature more...
Our bodies are so fragile to the elements from our home - Earth. If I were to walk barefoot now, that's all I'd be focusing on. 

Even though I am right beside the city, and can hear it clearly... looking out, I want to climb the tallest tree we pass by, just to see the city again. 


Mud Bay 

We are too close to the highway to feel like we are in "nature" 
The way the Earth works is so beautiful. Everything falls into the perfect puzzle. Each line matching up perfectly. And even when it seems like you are missing a piece, you look on the ground, and it is right there waiting.

Sitting in silence is one of my favourite things. I can have conversations with myself in my head if I am feeling talkitive, but have no one with me. 
Each of the rocks I pick up has a new texture, has a new smell, a new shape. All unique, but placed perfectly. 

I want to visit the little island over there that hasn't been touched. But if I do, it will have been touched by humans just like everything else. 

The mud here shatters here like crackled nailpolish. A common trend when I was in highschool. It feels like I should be falling through the cracks, but everything holds onto me. Like I'm tucked safely in the pouch of my mother's warmth. I am safe here.
