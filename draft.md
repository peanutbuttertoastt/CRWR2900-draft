Burns Bog 
-Even in a nature reserve, you can still hear the egos of people from the honks of their overpriced cars

-Do the animals know that the commotion is from humans? Do they blame someone?

-The mossy ground bounces like a trampoline/like a sponge

- Moss growing in a carboard cut out sign 

-Sitka spruce, play my instrument 

-The black spruce trees look like tree people

*being at the back of the group isn't so bad.. you get more solitude

-A douglas fir NEEDS a forest fire in order to survive
