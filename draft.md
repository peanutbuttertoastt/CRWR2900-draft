Burns Bog: 
-It's interesting how quikcly you can forget somewhere that you were only weeks ago 
-Humans just HAVE to be a part of every part of life hey?
-Even in a nature reserve, you can still hear the egos of people from the honks of their overpriced cars
-Do the animals the commotion is from us/humans... do they blame someone?

-Just close you eyes for a moment and feel the blanket of the sun
