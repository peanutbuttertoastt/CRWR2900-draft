# Your Assignment

This is a writing course. Accordingly, you will write a composition. The
minimum length of your (final) composition is 3,000 words. You will
create this composition in several stages, from rough draft to final
polish. Each stage will be graded. You may write more than 3,000
words, if you like.

Your composition can be in any genre and on any topic you choose. The
goal is to choose a subject about which you are passionate and to write in a form and style that best further your creativity and your passions. Ideally, you will add short narrative sections to your draft over a period of several weeks as we complete the weekly activities. These sections might not immediately fit together, but they will add imagery, sound, colour, shape, and metaphor. You can pick and choose which of these sections you keep, but they are an excellent way to start writing without actually planning a narrative.

Take a look at the [posts](https://crwr4130.netlify.com/posts/) on the course website. You will see several creative narratives (such as [The Bear](https://crwr4130.netlify.com/education/creativity/2017/08/02/the-bear-a-mythological-vignette/), [Big Problems: Small Wonder](https://crwr4130.netlify.com/education/2017/07/31/big-problems-small-wonder/), [Windbreaker](https://crwr4130.netlify.com/education/creativity/2017/08/06/windbreaker/), and others). In addition, you can see 16 different creative narratives in your instructor's online books [here](https://www.rosslaird.com/grain-of-truth/) and [here](https://www.rosslaird.com/stones-throw/). Overall, you have roughly 150,000 words worth of example content from your instructor to help you understand what a narrative of creativity might look like. You also have the examples of the course readings. Your job is to make a narrative of your own.

This is the hard part: deciding what to write about. You must decide; your instructor won't assign a topic for you. The first step in authentic creativity involves getting a bit uncomfortable, and this kind of freedom in an academic setting is usually uncomfortable. Stick with the discomfort until something happens. Use the hacker's approach:

> You… have to develop a kind of faith in your own learning capacity — 
> a belief that even though you may not know all of what you need to solve a problem, 
> if you tackle just a piece of it and learn from that, you’ll learn enough 
> to solve the next piece — and so on, until you’re done.

## Grades

The composition assignment will be completed in three stages (three drafts of the same document). You will simply continue to update your document with new text, saving your changes using the GitHub `commit` mechanism (see below). Each commit is worth one point, to a maximum of 25 points. Each of the three drafts is also worth 25 points (see below for compositional criteria). So, overall, here is how the grades look:

First Draft | Second Draft | Third Draft | Commits
------------ | ------------- | -------------| -----------
25 | 25 | 25 | 25


## The Composition Process

During the first week of the semester you will receive a link, via email, to a GitHub repository which will be your online space to work on your composition. You will write your composition on GitHub, saving your changes as you go. We will examine this process more closely in the coming weeks.

## Getting started

Click the link you received, via email, to your personal repository. Login to GitHub (if you haven't already) and open the repository. You will see a file called `draft.md`. Click on the file name to open it. You will see some sample text. Click the pencil icon above and to the right (beside the trashcan) to edit the file. (You can ignore the buttons that say Raw, Blame, and History.)

Edit your text using Markdown format (see [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)). You can toggle between editing and previewing using the tabs at the top of the editing box (the `Preview changes` tab has an eye icon). When you have written a few sentences (or even less), scroll to the bottom of the screen where a green button says `Commit changes`. Don't click that button yet. First, add a comment in the small box; something like "I wrote a paragraph about cookies". Suggested text is provided in this box; feel free to use that.

In the larger box below, add an "optional extended description". You don't have to do this if you are committing (saving) only a sentence or two; but if you have added a significant chunk of text, you should say something about your process. Here are some possibilities:

* A note about how it's going overall
* A comment about how you are feeling about the composition
* A reminder to yourself about some aspect of the composition

Commit messages are an excellent way to track what you have done and why.

When you are ready to save your document, click the button that says `Commit`. Don't worry about the two small buttons that allow you to choose a branch. We won't be using those.

## Adding Files

Feel free to add new files to the repository (for example, to create an outline or to collect notes). Don't create new drafts; use the `draft.md` file for all of your composition and editing. But if your creative impulse is to use more files to keep track of what you are doing, by all means do that (give new files an `.md` extension; that way, GitHub will identify them as Markdown files).

#### Tip: Remember to bookmark your repository! You will be returning to it many times.

## Privacy 

Your repository is only accessible by you and your instructor.

## Markdown Examples

Take a look at the Markdown examples in the [Markdown docs](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax) for GitHub. These examples will show you how to use special formatting (which, probably, you won't need if you are writing a personal essay).

## Writing, Editing, and Saving

Edit your document in your browser window. Save the document often, by using the "Commit changes" box at the bottom. Every time you make a substantive save (when you "make a commit"), add a comment in both commit boxes. The top box is for a one-liner comment; the bottom box is for notes to yourself or explanations to your instructor. GitHub handily provides sample text for the top box. The bottom box is for keeping track of what you are thinking about or planning as you work on the document (as described previously).

### Line Wrapping

The default line wrapping method on GitHub is `soft wrap.` That's probably the best option. You can also choose `no wrap` to see how that works. Both options are available at the top of the editing box.

# Each commit is worth one point!

Every time you make a commit that includes a comment in the top and bottom box, and if that commit reflects new or revised material (more than a single change), you will receive one point. Please make at least 25 commits; doing so will earn you 25 points, which is the maximum number of points earned for this portion of the course. You may find that you make more than 25 commits; that's fine. Make as many as you like. You will not earn any more points, but you may find that you track your document better. (Your instructor makes a commit about every ten minutes when working on a document, so that's about one commit for every few sentences.)

You can view your commit history and many other details about your activity inside your repository (as can your instructor) by clicking the `Insights` tab, then `Graphs`.

Normally you will commit to the `master` branch. You will see this option whenever you make a commit. You will also see another option, to create a new branch and make a `pull request`. We won't be using that feature, so you can safely ignore it. (But if you are curious, you can read the GitHub documentation for [branching](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).)

Whenever you have finished working on your document for the day, be sure to commit your final changes. Whenever you are ready to work again, open the url of your draft, open the editing screen, and continue along.

If you get stuck with any of this, ask for help in class or open an issue (using the 'issues` tab above).

## Previewing Your Document Formatting

Every time you save (commit) your changes, or if you just view your document without editing it, GitHub will render your Markdown into HTML and show the document to you in your browser. This is an excellent way to check your formatting. You can also accomplish the same thing by clicking the `Preview changes` button (with an eye icon) whenever you are editing. Click `Edit file` to return to editing. 

## Do not write in Word!

The main advantage of using GitHub is that it preserves the history of your document: all of your additions, changes, amendments, revisions, and so on. Each time you save (commit) your document, GitHub saves the history of your changes, and the instructor can browse those changes. This process is crucial to the instructor for giving feedback to you. If you work around the system (say, by coping and pasting from Word), your document will have no history, and the instructor will be unable to give you effective feedback (and a grade). So, please use the tools you have been asked to use. They may be unfamiliar now, but they are the basis of all writing online. You should know about them.

To give you a sense of how GitHub tracks activity on documents (files), you can look at the account page for any user. Your instructor's account page is [here](https://github.com/rosslaird).

## Commit Often

It helps. The more often you commit (say, after every paragraph or so), the easier it is to use GitHub's tools to traverse the history of your document. Remember that you should make at least 25 commits to your document in order to earn 25 points for this portion of the course.

## Submitting Your Document for Review

You do not need to submit anything or to signal that your draft is ready for review. Just keep working and committing (saving). Ross will review your draft in the week following the due dates above and will give you feedback on GitHub directly.

### An Alternate Workflow

Note that you don't _have to_ use the GitHub web interface to write and edit your document. You can use various tools that connect directly to GitHub. Here are a few:

#### GitHub on your desktop

* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (Mac and Windows)
* [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) (Mac, Windows, and Linux)

#### Text Editors

If you use one of the tools above to bring GitHub to your desktop, you will also need to use a text editor that works well with Markdown. Here are a few of the most popular:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) (built by GitHub)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) (very powerful, but not for the faint-of-heart)
* [Writeroom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom) (Mac only)
* [iAWriter](https://ia.net/writer/) (Mac only)
* [ByWord](https://bywordapp.com/) (Mac only)
* [LightPaper](http://lightpaper.42squares.in/) (Mac only)
* [Markdown Pad](http://www.markdownpad.com/) (Windows)
* [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com/) (Mac only)
* [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) (Mac only)

If you go this route (working on your desktop), the steps are as follows:

1. Clone the repository (using a desktop GitHub application, or the command line if you are courageous).
2. Open your draft document on your computer. Edit the document.
3. Commit local changes on your computer (using the desktop application or the command line).
4. Push your changes to the repository on GitHub (using the desktop application or the command line).

Working from your computer (as opposed to from the GitHub website) involves more steps. However, working in your text editor, on your computer, is generally a more pleasant experience than working from the GitHub website. Choose the manner that suits you best -- but be aware that working from GitHub, in your browser, is the easiest method and the one that I recommend.

### Into the Deep End

You are also welcome to use this course as an opportunity to learn [git](https://git-scm.com/), and to work completely from the command line. I applaud this approach but do not recommend it. If you want to try this, please speak to me.

## Assessment Criteria for the Creative Composition
Projects for this course are focused on authentic and creative
inquiry. Accordingly, the following criteria – which are based on the
philosophy of creative inquiry – are used to evaluate engagement and
commitment to the composition project:

* Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself.
* Willingness to try new things, especially when doing so provokes discomfort.
* Openness to personal and interpersonal process.
* Willingness to collaborate with others.
* Consideration of and responsiveness to others.
* Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.
* Ability to take personal responsibility and initiative for learning.
* Willingness to approach academic inquiry as a skill with discrete steps and standards.
* Commitment to improvement in writing and creative work.
* Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.

In addition to the above criteria, compositional criteria are also
used to evaluate your writing, as follows (in percentages):

##### 80 − 100
Excellent: the use of language is pleasing and vigorous. The writing
invites reading; the work is well-crafted and grammatically
flawless. The author is perceptive.

##### 76 − 79
Very good: the use of language is generally correct. There may be a
need for further editing. This could be in the presentation of the
work (style, voice, characterisation, plot, point of view), or in the
language (diction, grammar, usage, spelling, punctuation) — but the
writing is involving.

##### 72 − 75
Good: the author has created a composition with substantial content
and without any serious errors in tone or narration. Problems with
creative shaping and delivery may occur, and there may be a further
need for learning the mechanics of language use, but generally, the
problems do not interfere with the reader’s appreciation of the work.

##### 68 − 71
Compositions with repeated errors in grammar, usage or punctuation
will result in a grade of no higher than 71 regardless of the
proficiency and imagination demonstrated in the creative aspects of
the work. On the other hand, compositions with no problems in grammar,
usage or punctuation may not receive a grade higher than 71 if they
fail to demonstrate an understanding of the challenges (of style or
voice, for example) involved in writing in the genre.

##### 64 − 67
Satisfactory: this writing shows constrained use of language (either
in the creative shaping and delivery of content or in repeated errors
in grammar punctuation, diction and usage), and the treatment of the
material has not resulted in sufficient depth. The writing is
potentially interesting, and a revision may improve the composition.

##### 60 − 63
This meets the minimum criteria of the assignment without in any way
exceeding it. There are repeated errors such as spelling mistakes,
sloppiness or a lack of depth to the writing.

##### 56 − 59
Below average: the writing is difficult to read because of
inappropriate delivery or repeated grammatical errors or
both. Furthermore, the idea may not be appropriate for the form. This
grade does not permit students to pursue another course for which the
graded course was a prerequisite.

##### 50 − 55
Fail: the author fails to understand the nature of creative writing or
has not tried.
